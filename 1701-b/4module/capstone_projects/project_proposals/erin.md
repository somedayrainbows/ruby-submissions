### Project Template

### CityRace

### Pitch

CityRace is an app that allows users to create and run custom urban scavenger hunts and invite teams to participate. Each hunt is a race to the finish!

### Problem

Many of the custom scavenger apps on the market are points-based and expensive.

### Solution

I wanted to create a race-based app to manage a custom hunt I designed and ran successfully using spreadsheets and a messaging app over three years. This app will be free and open source, making it more accessible to teams with limited budgets such as groups of friends, schools and nonprofits, and other organizations.

### Target Audience

The target audience for this app initially comprises able-bodied and adventure-minded adults in urban areas.

### New Techniques

I would like to explore React with a Rails backend. I would also like to experiment with real-time messaging if time allows.

### Workflow

Trello
