### [Project Title]

### Pitch

1 sentence that explains the value proposition of the application. How would you explain it to a potential business partner, team member, or investor?

LadyBuilt is a platform that makes it easy for the public to find and support women-owned businesses while providing additional features to help women owners find and collaborate with other women owners in areas such as cross-marketing and promotion, information sharing about topics such as fundraising and scaling a business, and more.

### Problem

It's no secret that Women are underrepresented as business owners and leaders in the U.S. economy. While there are dispersed resources available to women business owners and general networking communities for professional women, there is no single application that supports local communities of women business owners and leaders to especially those in technology, breweries and restaurants, outdoor goods manufacturing, and several other key industries traditionally dominated by men. 

### Solution

LadyBuilt will provide two solutions to this problem: 1) The app will connect women business owners so that the lonely startup path, made harder for women starting up in male-dominated industries, will involve community, advice, mentoring, and business support, and 2) it will also provide the public with an easy way to find and support women-owned businesses.

### Target Audience

I have two audiences: 1) Women owners and founders of businesses in a few key industries (to start), such as technology and breweries, and 2) the general public. I will focus on the needs of the former for the purpose of this project, however, with some public features available that I develop first for the women owner user.

### New Techniques

I would like to explore React with a Rails backend. I would also like to implement messaging for women ownders with Action Cable (Rails) or Socket.io and React as well as maps/location functionality.

### Workflow

I plan to use Pivotal Tracker to manage my progress.
